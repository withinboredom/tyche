# Installing Tyche

Installing tyche is pretty easy. In fact, it's as easy as installing an npm package:

{{% notice info %}}
Be aware that node 6.5.0 or higher is required for this tool on Windows.
{{% /notice %}}

``` bash
npm install -g tyche
```

Once installed, you're ready to configure a project to use tyche as a build tool.
